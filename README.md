**BetterChat** is a plugin that works with **BakkesMod**, allowing you to choose which quickchats you want to disallow at which points in the game (after a goal, after a save, etc.). There is also an anti-spam function. At the end of the game, you get the toxicity score of each player (i.e. a recap of the number of blocked messages for each player).

In this way, you can make the usual toxic Rocket League chat more respectful and focus on your gameplay.

**If you have any suggestions to improve the plugin, don't hesitate to create an [Issue](https://github.com/JulienML/BetterChat/issues) or a [Pull Request](https://github.com/JulienML/BetterChat/pulls)!**

Each configuration is composed of two features: an Anti-Spam and a Message Filter.

## Anti-Spam

| Without Anti-Spam | With Anti-Spam |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|

In the Anti-Spam section, you can set the delay between two identical quickchat from the same player.

## Message Filter

| Without the Message Filter | With the Message Filter |
