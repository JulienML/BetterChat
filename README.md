**BetterChat** is a plugin that works with **BakkesMod**, allowing you to choose which quickchats you want to disallow at which points in the game (after a goal, after a save, etc.). There is also an anti-spam function. At the end of the game, you get the toxicity score of each player (i.e. a recap of the number of blocked messages for each player).

In this way, you can make the usual toxic Rocket League chat more respectful and focus on your gameplay without tilting 👍

**If you have any suggestions to improve the plugin, don't hesitate to create an [Issue](https://github.com/JulienML/BetterChat/issues) or a [Pull Request](https://github.com/JulienML/BetterChat/pulls)!**

#  Configuration

You can configure the plugin easily by pressing F2 -> Plugins -> BetterChat Plugin.

Here, you can configure the two features: the anti-spam and the message filter.

## Anti-Spam

| Without Anti-Spam | With Anti-Spam |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| ![Gif1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108280870/297385991-b60ccd7b-1461-4352-8a42-d5d43518d679.gif) | ![Gif2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108280870/297386150-fafc56e7-0464-4811-8598-7d1d8c21db53.gif) |

In the Anti-Spam section, you can set the delay between two identical quickchat from the same player.

## Message Filter

| Without the Message Filter | With the Message Filter |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| ![Gif3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108280870/297386506-b0152ce6-dd2c-41ab-b528-f302037bab8c.gif) | ![Gif4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108280870/297386316-dc14da4c-5fab-49f0-ae75-6e4aec44fe33.gif) |

In the Message Filter section, you can disallow the quickchat you want by checking them in the first column on the table.

Once you check a quickchat, it appears in the other columns, which correspond to different events in the game. In this way, you can allow quickchat only for certain events (for exemple, you can authorize the 'What a save!' quickchat only after a save).

At the bottom, you can configure the position of the toxicity scores at the end of the game:
